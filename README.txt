This project is intended to provide a way to search and update student-to-device 
status and history. This workflow is currently done on paper with the aid of several 
google spreadsheets, an Access database, and MS Word mail merge.  The generated 
paper files are stored in a filing cabinet.

This project should enable the electronic capture and review of this information.
